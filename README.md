## Architecture

Our project is based on the MaterialUI default theme.
In our architecture we have five pages : Graph, Lists, Map, SignIn and SignUp.
To go to these pages [Othmane met les routes ici]
We also have three components : AppDrawer which provide a navigation bar with a vertical menu, ShowHowManyCase to show on every page of the application the number of confirmed cases and ThemeModal which is the switch in the app bar to change the theme mode.
